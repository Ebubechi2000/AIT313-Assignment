QUESTION 1:

LOCATE 5 DISRUPTION OF AIHere are 5 potential disruptions of AI:

i. Job Displacement
AI has the potential to automate many jobs, particularly those that involve repetitive tasks or can be easily optimized by machines. This could lead to significant job displacement, especially in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and customer service.

ii. Bias and Discrimination
AI systems can perpetuate existing biases and discrimination if they are trained on biased data or designed with a particular worldview. This can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate social inequalities.

iii. Cybersecurity Risks
As AI becomes more ubiquitous, it also becomes a potential target for cyber attacks. AI systems can be vulnerable to data poisoning, model inversion, and other types of attacks that can compromise their integrity and confidentiality.

 iv. Loss of Human Agency
As AI becomes more advanced, there is a risk that humans will become too reliant on machines and lose their agency and autonomy. This can lead to a loss of critical thinking skills and a diminished ability to make decisions.

v. Existential Risks
Some experts have raised concerns that advanced AI systems could pose an existential risk to humanity, particularly if they become superintelligent and are able to modify their own goals and objectives. This could lead to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic outcomes.

QUESTION 2 
Mention 5 advantages of AI

 a. Improved Efficiency and Productivity
AI can automate repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up human resources for more strategic and creative work. AI-powered tools can also optimize business processes, leading to increased productivity and efficiency.

b. Enhanced Decision-Making
AI can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions, enabling businesses to make informed decisions. AI-powered systems can also provide real-time insights, allowing for quick response to changing market conditions.

c. Personalized Customer Experience
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide personalized customer service, helping businesses to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. AI can also analyze customer data to offer tailored recommendations and promotions.

 d. Improved Healthcare Outcomes
AI can help healthcare professionals diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly, leading to better patient outcomes. AI-powered systems can also analyze medical data to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes.

e. Increased Accessibility and Inclusivity
AI-powered tools can help people with disabilities, such as visual or hearing impairments, to interact with technology more easily. AI-powered systems can also provide language translation services, breaking down language barriers and increasing accessibility to information and services.

QUESTION 3

Mention 5 disadvantages of AI

a. Job Displacement and Unemployment
AI has the potential to automate many jobs, particularly those that involve repetitive tasks or can be easily optimized by machines. This could lead to significant job displacement and unemployment, especially for low-skilled workers.

b. Bias and Discrimination
AI systems can perpetuate existing biases and discrimination if they are trained on biased data or designed with a particular worldview. This can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate social inequalities.

c. Dependence on Data Quality
AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is inaccurate, incomplete, or biased, the AI system will produce flawed results. This can lead to incorrect decisions and actions.

d. Cybersecurity Risks
AI systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, particularly if they are connected to the internet. This can lead to data breaches, system compromises, and other security risks.

e. Lack of Transparency and Accountability
AI systems can be complex and difficult to understand, making it challenging to identify accountability when something goes wrong. This lack of transparency and accountability can lead to mistrust and skepticism about AI.
